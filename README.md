## Purpose
- explore a bit of Kotlin (coming from Java)
- learn the basics of Spring Boot (inversion of control, dependency injection, beans, annotations)
- play around with WebSockets' real-time persistent connection
- learn how coroutines work

## Core Features
- join lobby with a nickname, late-joiners to game are auto-kicked
- core game loop (including Quiz Timers) handled by coroutines
- real time updates (through WebSockets): player scores, players joining and leaving the lobby, Quiz Timers
- disconnected player don't disrupt the current game

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Kotlin + Spring Boot, WebSockets, Kotlin Coroutines
- **Frontend**: React.js
